# deliberate: cloning an image copies one cloud credential onto every kit, and
# Box and Drive invalidate a token when another device refreshes it, so all but
# the first kit silently stop uploading weeks later. Building each card fresh
# gives it its own credential and removes the problem entirely.
#
# Safe to re-run. Every step is idempotent, so if something fails you can fix
# it and run the script again rather than starting the card over.
